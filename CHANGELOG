openengsb-2.4.5 2012-04-29
--------------------------------------------

The fifth bug-fix release of the OpenEngSB Framework tons of issues internal and various issues by
upgrading various libraries. The release fixes various errors in the documentation; fixed the
permission error of the config directory; fixed various tests; a nullpointer exception in the EDB,
and abstracted the primitives handling by using ClassUtils in commons-lang. This release is more
stable by upgrading openengsb-root (v33), PaxExam Karaf (v0.5.3), Apache CXF (v2.5.3),
Apache Karaf (v2.2.7), Pax Exam (v2.3.1), Apache Felix File Install (v3.2.2), OPS4J Pax Web (v1.0.9)
and Apache Felix Gogo (v0.10.0). All in all we've reduced the number of known issues from 17 to 15.

openengsb-2.1.0 2011-10-21 
--------------------------------------------

The second release of the 2.x series of the OpenEngSB Framework fixed 61 issues. Among the various bugs we where able to
make jaxws work out of the box in the OpenEngSB framework, removing jre 1.5 pseudo compability and finally deploy the
sources to m2 central. The OpenEngSBCoreService#getConfigPersistence and EngineeringKnowledgeBase had been deprecated
opening the doors for better, new implementations of them. There had been various minor improvements to the UI; But the
most important improvement was definitely that all scripts could now be setup via setenv/setenv.bat which does not longer
forces child projects to write all scripts for themselves. In addition this makes start, stop, ... scripts work as 
expected. Another important change was that we've splitted the background persistence bundle into three main bundles 
which could be configured and replaced now as required. To complete the new feature set of the 2.1.0 release of the
OpenEngSB Framework we've included an upgrade for Apache Karaf (2.2.4), Apache CXF (2.4.3), Apache Wicket (1.4.19),

openengsb-1.3.0.M3 2011-07-15 
--------------------------------------------

The third milestone release of the OpenEngSB fixes 86 issues. The most important enhancement is the introduction
of pax-wicket into the OpenEngSB. This is the base for splitting up the UI and help to reuse and extend it into
user applications as required. A first prototype of the Enterprise Database 2.0 shows the way we want to go in
versioning tool data. A new pipline architecture allows secured remote calls and the console prototype shows where
we want to go in future 1.3 milestone releases. The newly added configuration backends help to configure the 
OpenEngSB using files. Finally bugs, identified in former 1.3.0.Mx releases, are fixed. Also worth mentioning: 
The speed and stability of the OpenEngSB had been increased.

of security and more complex operations in future 1.3 milestone releases. Besides, new example connectors had been

been increased.

### Highlights

  * New administration page to wire connectors via the UI
  * Ports remote structure is now based on filter/pipelining
  * Completely rewritten C# examples
